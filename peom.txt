Premier and the Unicorn

Premier they said
Burnley in clarinet and blue
Worst team in the England
Says everyone but you

Arsenal who lead
Best team in london
All the others tried
But London will always be Red

Unicorns are new
They are silky and white
With their horns on their head
They'll always be right!
